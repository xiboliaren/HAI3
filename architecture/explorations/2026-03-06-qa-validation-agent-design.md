## Research question

What are the best practices, patterns, tools, and anti-patterns for designing an AI QA/validation agent that performs actual runtime verification (not just static analysis) in a multi-agent system? The agent will replace two narrower agents: a browser-based runtime tester (Chrome DevTools MCP) and a static code reviewer.

Sub-questions:
1. How do leading AI frameworks structure QA/validator/critic agents?
2. What runtime validation approaches work for agent-driven testing (browser, CLI, API)?
3. How should static analysis integrate with runtime testing in a single agent?
4. How should a QA agent decide what to test, handle non-determinism, and report findings?
5. What prompt patterns make QA agents effective without becoming bottlenecks?
6. What is the minimum viable toolset for a QA agent that actually validates?
7. What are the common anti-patterns and failure modes?
8. What real-world implementations exist?

## Scope

**In scope**: QA agent design patterns, runtime validation tools, static analysis integration, test strategy, prompt engineering for QA roles, tool selection, anti-patterns, and real-world examples. All findings are oriented toward a Claude Code subagent context.

**Out of scope**: Architecture review (covered by the `architecture-critic` agent). Designing the actual agent prompt (this exploration provides decision-support material). CI/CD pipeline integration. Test framework authoring (the QA agent validates, it does not write persistent test suites).

**Constraints**: The agent operates within the HAI3 monorepo as a Claude Code subagent. It has access to Chrome DevTools MCP tools, Bash, file reading tools, and potentially Playwright MCP. It replaces the current `chrome-devtools-runtime-tester` and `implementation-reviewer` agents.

## Findings

### 1. QA agent design patterns in AI systems

#### 1.1 The generator-critic pattern

Google's [multi-agent design patterns guide](https://docs.cloud.google.com/architecture/choose-design-pattern-agentic-ai-system) identifies eight essential patterns for multi-agent systems. Pattern 5, **Generator and Critic**, directly addresses quality validation: one agent creates output, another validates it against predefined criteria, with an optional feedback loop for iterative refinement.

The pattern operates as a conditional loop: the critic reviews the generator's output against hard-coded criteria or logical checks. If the review passes, the loop breaks and the output is finalized. If it fails, specific feedback routes back to the generator to produce a compliant revision. Google's [ADK implementation](https://developers.googleblog.com/developers-guide-to-multi-agent-patterns-in-adk/) separates this into a `SequentialAgent` managing the draft-and-review interaction and a parent `LoopAgent` enforcing the quality gate and exit condition.

A generalization is Pattern 6, **Iterative Refinement**, where the generator's output is submitted to both a critique agent and a refiner agent working together to improve the original output iteratively.

The critical design insight: the critic validates against **specific, predefined criteria** -- not open-ended quality assessment. Vague validation ("is this good?") produces inconsistent results. Concrete criteria ("does this compile? does this endpoint return 200? does this DOM element exist?") produce reliable verdicts.

**Confidence:** Corroborated -- Google's patterns are documented with code samples in ADK, consistent with patterns observed across CrewAI, AutoGen, and LangGraph.

#### 1.2 Multi-agent QA architectures in practice

Several production architectures demonstrate QA agent positioning:

**OpenObserve's Council of Sub Agents** uses an 8-agent pipeline with a dedicated Sentinel (quality gate auditor) and Healer (iterative test fixer). The Sentinel is a blocking gate -- it can halt the pipeline if quality standards are not met. The Healer iterates up to 5 times until tests pass or determines the functionality is genuinely broken ([OpenObserve blog](https://openobserve.ai/blog/autonomous-qa-testing-ai-agents-claude-code/)).

**CrewAI workflows** typically include a Validator agent as the fifth role alongside Identifier, Researcher, Composer, and Orchestrator. The Validator functions as a critic agent for quality assurance on outputs before finalization ([CrewAI lessons](https://blog.crewai.com/lessons-from-2-billion-agentic-workflows/)).

**metaswarm** (18 agents, 13 skills) executes a 4-phase quality loop: implement with TDD, validate independently with blocking coverage enforcement, adversarial review against the spec, and commit only after PASS. Quality gates are [blocking state transitions, not advisory](https://github.com/dsifry/metaswarm) -- there is no instruction path from FAIL to COMMIT.

The consistent pattern across all implementations: **QA agents are positioned as blocking gates, not optional reviewers.** When the QA verdict is advisory, teams learn to ignore it.

**Confidence:** Corroborated -- observed across multiple independent production systems.

#### 1.3 Framework-specific patterns

| Framework | QA/Validation Mechanism | Key Characteristic |
|-----------|------------------------|--------------------|
| Google ADK | Generator-Critic with LoopAgent | Critic validates against predefined criteria; conditional loop until pass |
| CrewAI | Role-based Validator agent | Declarative tool scoping; structured output validation |
| AutoGen | Conversational critic via message passing | Docker sandboxing for safe execution; agents debate via messages |
| LangGraph | Stateful graph nodes for validation | Re-planning cycles on failure; checkpoint-based quality gates |
| OpenAI Agents SDK | Guardrails (input/output validators) | Input guardrails validate before model; output guardrails validate after; built-in tracing captures full execution flow |
| Claude Code | Subagent with tool scoping + hooks | PreToolUse hooks for conditional validation; SubagentStop hooks for handoff; persistent memory for cross-session learning |

The OpenAI Agents SDK takes a distinct approach: rather than a separate critic agent, it embeds [guardrails as functions](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/guardrails/) that run alongside agent execution. Input guardrails validate messages before they reach the model; output guardrails validate responses before they reach the user. Guardrails can be simple Python functions or LLM-powered validators using a separate lightweight model.

**Confidence:** Substantiated -- drawn from official documentation of each framework.

#### 1.4 Developer-to-QA feedback loops

Three orchestration patterns govern how QA feedback flows ([Shipyard blog](https://shipyard.build/blog/claude-code-multi-agent/)):

1. **Pipeline (sequential handoff)**: Developer finishes, QA validates, result returned. Simple but no iteration -- fails require restarting the pipeline.
2. **Fan-out/fan-in (parallel decomposition)**: Multiple QA checks run in parallel, results synthesized. Fast but no feedback loop.
3. **Feedback loop (iterative refinement)**: QA returns findings to developer, developer fixes, QA re-validates. Most thorough but most expensive.

The feedback loop pattern maps to the Generator-Critic loop: the developer is the generator, the QA agent is the critic. The key design decision is **how many iterations before escalation to a human**. metaswarm and OpenObserve both cap iterations (metaswarm: spec-driven, OpenObserve: 5 healing attempts).

Claude Code subagents support this through the [resume mechanism](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents) -- a completed subagent can be resumed with full conversation history, enabling iterative refinement without starting fresh.

**Confidence:** Substantiated -- patterns documented across multiple sources; iteration cap is an engineering judgment.

#### 1.5 Quality gates as blocking state transitions

The strongest pattern emerging across implementations: **quality gates must be blocking, not advisory.**

metaswarm enforces this structurally: there is no code path from FAIL to COMMIT. The orchestrator runs `tsc`, `eslint`, `vitest`, and coverage enforcement itself, and [quality gates are blocking state transitions](https://github.com/dsifry/metaswarm).

CodeScene's analysis of agentic coding patterns confirms: "kicking the AI into a refactoring loop on any quality issues" through automated checks at generation, pre-commit, and PR stages. Hard coverage thresholds act as regression signals that prevent agents from [deleting tests when facing failures](https://codescene.com/blog/agentic-ai-coding-best-practice-patterns-for-speed-with-quality).

Claude Code supports this through hooks: a `PreToolUse` hook can [validate operations before they execute](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents), and a `SubagentStop` hook can require quality checks before handoff.

**Confidence:** Corroborated -- consistent across metaswarm, CodeScene, and OpenObserve implementations.

### 2. Runtime validation approaches

#### 2.1 Browser automation tool comparison

Three MCP-based browser automation approaches exist for AI agent use, each with different trade-offs ([BSWEN comparison](https://docs.bswen.com/blog/2026-02-25-mcp-browser-comparison/)):

| Metric | Playwright MCP | Chrome DevTools MCP | OpenBrowser MCP |
|--------|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Tool count | 21 tools | 26 tools | 1 tool (Python code) |
| Token usage (relative) | 3.2x baseline | 6x baseline | 1x baseline |
| Payload size (relative) | 48x baseline | 144x baseline | 1x baseline |
| Browser support | Chromium, Firefox, WebKit | Chrome only | Chrome only |
| Strength | Cross-browser testing, CI/CD | Deep debugging, performance analysis | Token efficiency, flexibility |
| Monthly tokens (1000 daily tasks) | ~96M | ~180M | ~30M |

Chrome DevTools MCP provides the deepest browser introspection: performance traces, network request analysis, console log inspection, DOM/CSS inspection, and live debugging. It solves the fundamental problem that ["coding agents are not able to see what the code they generate actually does when it runs in the browser"](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-devtools-mcp).

Playwright MCP uses the browser's accessibility tree for [fast, deterministic control](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-agents) and provides cross-browser support. It is better suited for user behavior simulation and automated testing pipelines.

**Confidence:** Corroborated -- based on official documentation from Google and Microsoft, plus independent benchmarks.

#### 2.2 Playwright test agents

Playwright v1.56 (October 2025) introduced three [built-in test agents](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-agents):

1. **Planner**: Explores live applications through a real browser, discovers user flows and edge cases, produces structured markdown test plans.
2. **Generator**: Converts markdown plans into executable Playwright tests, verifying selectors and assertions live during generation.
3. **Healer**: Runs failing tests, inspects current UI to locate equivalent elements, suggests patches (locator updates, timing adjustments), re-runs until pass or declares broken.

The Healer pattern is particularly relevant: it provides a self-healing validation loop where tests automatically adapt to UI changes. This is distinct from a QA agent that validates correctness -- the Healer validates that tests themselves are current.

GitHub Copilot's Coding Agent [leverages Playwright MCP to open a browser and validate tasks](https://developer.microsoft.com/blog/the-complete-playwright-end-to-end-story-tools-ai-and-real-world-workflows) assigned to it, demonstrating the pattern of agent-driven browser validation in production.

**Confidence:** Substantiated -- Playwright test agents are documented but relatively new (6 months old at time of writing).

#### 2.3 Chrome DevTools MCP

The HAI3 `chrome-devtools-runtime-tester` already uses Chrome DevTools MCP. Key capabilities relevant to QA validation:

- **DOM and CSS inspection**: Element presence, visibility, attribute changes, class additions/removals, ARIA attributes
- **Network behavior**: Request/response patterns, status codes, headers, timing
- **Console analysis**: JavaScript errors, unhandled promise rejections, warnings
- **Performance**: Animation frame timing, layout thrashing, memory patterns, LCP/CLS/FID
- **User interaction simulation**: Navigate, fill forms, click, hover, drag, type, press keys
- **Screenshots**: Visual capture for evidence collection

The current `chrome-devtools-runtime-tester` uses 26 Chrome DevTools tools plus file reading tools (Glob, Grep, Read). It consumes significant context window space (18k tokens for tool definitions alone).

**Confidence:** Corroborated -- based on the existing HAI3 agent definition and Chrome DevTools MCP documentation.

#### 2.4 CLI and shell validation

For CLI validation, Bash tool access enables:

- Running build commands (`npm run build`, `tsc --noEmit`) and checking exit codes
- Executing test suites (`npm test`, `vitest run`) and parsing output
- Linting (`eslint`, `prettier --check`) with structured output
- Type checking with error collection
- File system verification (checking generated files exist, have correct content)
- Git status inspection (ensuring only expected files changed)
- Process/server status verification

Anthropic's guide on [demystifying evals](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/demystifying-evals-for-ai-agents) notes that deterministic graders are natural for coding agents because software is straightforward to evaluate -- solutions pass only if they fix failing tests without breaking existing ones. This principle applies directly: a QA agent should run the same deterministic checks a CI pipeline would run.

**Confidence:** Substantiated -- standard practice across coding agent implementations.

#### 2.5 Combining multiple validation channels

The strongest QA agents combine multiple validation channels rather than relying on a single approach. A synthesized validation stack:

| Channel | What it validates | When to use |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| Bash (build/compile) | Code compiles, no type errors | Always -- cheapest check, catches most issues |
| Bash (test suite) | Existing tests still pass, new tests pass | Always -- deterministic regression check |
| Bash (lint) | Code style, forbidden patterns | Always -- catches pattern violations |
| Chrome DevTools (DOM) | UI renders correctly, elements present | When changes affect UI |
| Chrome DevTools (network) | API calls work, correct payloads | When changes affect data fetching |
| Chrome DevTools (console) | No runtime errors | When changes affect behavior |
| Chrome DevTools (screenshot) | Visual correctness | When changes affect appearance |
| File read (code inspection) | Pattern compliance, architecture rules | When static analysis is needed |

The ordering matters: cheaper, faster, deterministic checks should run first. If `tsc --noEmit` fails, there is no point launching the browser.

**Confidence:** Substantiated -- synthesized from OpenObserve, metaswarm, and CodeScene patterns; ordering principle is engineering judgment.

---

### 3. Static analysis integration

#### 3.1 Combining static and runtime validation

The question is whether the QA agent should handle both static analysis (currently in `implementation-reviewer`) and runtime validation (currently in `chrome-devtools-runtime-tester`), or keep them separate.

Arguments for combining:
- A single quality gate reduces handoff overhead
- Static checks naturally precede runtime checks in a validation pipeline
- The QA agent can skip runtime validation if static analysis fails (short-circuit)
- Context about code patterns informs what to test at runtime

Arguments for keeping separate:
- Different model requirements (static analysis benefits from strong reasoning; runtime validation benefits from tool fluency)
- Different tool access requirements (static analysis is read-only; runtime validation needs browser interaction)
- Separation of concerns -- one agent doing too much produces inconsistent quality
- Context window pressure -- both roles consume significant context

The 9-parallel-agent pattern ([HAMY blog](https://hamy.xyz/blog/2026-02_code-reviews-claude-subagents)) demonstrates that specialization outperforms generalization for code review: running 9 focused agents in parallel at ~75% useful feedback beats a single comprehensive agent at <50%.

However, OpenObserve's Sentinel agent combines code auditing with quality gating in a single role, and it works because the Sentinel has a narrow, well-defined checklist rather than open-ended review authority.

**Confidence:** Substantiated -- both approaches have working implementations; the right choice depends on scope and specificity.

#### 3.2 Where to draw the line

Based on analysis of the existing `implementation-reviewer`, its checks fall into two categories:

**Automatable via Bash** (better as CLI checks than agent reasoning):
- `as any` detection (grep)
- `eslint-disable` detection (grep)
- `@ts-ignore` / `@ts-expect-error` detection (grep)
- Type safety violations (`tsc --noEmit`)
- Stray file detection (glob patterns)
- `.js` files in TypeScript directories (glob patterns)

**Requires agent reasoning** (legitimate QA agent work):
- Architecture violations (classes vs. standalone functions, SOLID compliance)
- Task integrity (do `[x]` tasks match actual code state?)
- Design doc mismatches (implementation vs. design)
- Code that compiles but does not match specification intent

The automation-candidates should be Bash commands the QA agent runs and checks exit codes for. The reasoning-candidates require the QA agent to read code and evaluate it against context.

Graphite's analysis notes that coding agents can [fix their own linting bugs and type errors if they have a way to check for them](https://graphite.com/guides/ai-code-review-vs-static-analysis), and static code analysis tools give coding agents "guardrails and constraints" that improve output quality.

**Confidence:** Substantiated -- based on direct analysis of the HAI3 `implementation-reviewer` agent definition and industry patterns.

#### 3.3 The parallel review agent pattern

HAMY's 9-parallel-agent setup runs specialized review agents simultaneously, each focused on one quality dimension:

1. Test Runner -- executes tests, reports pass/fail
2. Linter and Static Analysis -- runs linters, collects IDE diagnostics
3. Code Reviewer -- provides ranked improvements focused on non-obvious issues
4. Security Reviewer -- checks injection risks, auth issues, secrets
5. Quality and Style Reviewer -- reviews complexity, dead code, conventions
6. Test Quality Reviewer -- evaluates coverage ROI and behavior-focused testing
7. Performance Reviewer -- identifies N+1 queries, blocking operations, memory leaks
8. Dependency and Deployment Safety Reviewer -- reviews new dependencies, breaking changes
9. Simplification and Maintainability Reviewer -- asks if code could be simpler

All agents launch simultaneously via Task tool calls, results are synthesized into a prioritized summary. The author reports ~75% useful feedback. The key insight: this is used **as a pre-condition before the developer agent declares work "done"** rather than as a post-hoc review ([HAMY blog](https://hamy.xyz/blog/2026-02_code-reviews-claude-subagents)).

**Confidence:** Substantiated -- single implementation report, but consistent with the specialization-over-generalization pattern observed elsewhere.

---

### 4. Test strategy for AI QA agents

#### 4.1 The agent testing pyramid

Block Engineering's [testing pyramid for AI agents](https://engineering.block.xyz/blog/testing-pyramid-for-ai-agents) adapts the traditional pyramid for non-deterministic environments:

| Layer | What it validates | Approach | CI-friendly |
|-------|-------------------|----------|-------------|
| **Deterministic foundations** (base) | Core software correctness | Unit tests with mock providers; canned responses | Yes |
| **Reproducible reality** | Integration behavior | Record real interactions, replay deterministically | Yes |
| **Probabilistic performance** | Pattern reliability | Structured benchmarks, multiple iterations, aggregate results | Partially |
| **Vibes and judgment** (top) | Subjective quality | LLM-as-judge with explicit rubrics; majority vote across 3 runs | No |

Key insight: "a single run tells us almost nothing but patterns tell us everything." Non-determinism is managed through aggregation, not eliminated through assertion.

For a QA agent validating developer work, the relevant layers are:
- **Deterministic**: Run `tsc`, `eslint`, test suites -- these produce binary pass/fail
- **Reproducible**: Check specific DOM states, API responses, file contents -- deterministic given a running application
- **Probabilistic**: Overall code quality assessment -- inherently subjective

**Confidence:** Corroborated -- Block's framework is consistent with Anthropic's eval guidance and industry patterns.

#### 4.2 Risk-based testing for agents

AI agents can apply risk-based testing by:

1. **Mapping change scope to test priority**: Files changed -> affected components -> risk level -> test depth. A change to a shared utility affects more than a change to a leaf component.
2. **Using risk quadrants**: High-likelihood and high-impact areas receive exhaustive testing; low-risk areas get smoke tests ([TestGuild risk-based testing guide](https://testguild.com/risk-based-testing/)).
3. **Traceability matrices**: Map acceptance criteria to test ideas systematically -- Req ID -> Acceptance Criteria -> Test Ideas -> Notes.

The Agentic QE Fleet implements risk-weighted prioritization in its coverage analysis domain: [gap detection focuses on high-risk areas first](https://github.com/proffesor-for-testing/agentic-qe), allocating testing effort proportional to risk scores rather than code coverage percentages.

**Confidence:** Substantiated -- risk-based testing is well-established; application to AI agents is the researcher's synthesis from multiple sources.

#### 4.3 Handling non-determinism and flakiness

Non-determinism is the fundamental challenge for AI-driven validation. Key strategies:

**Classification of errors**: Distinguish [deterministic validation errors (type errors, missing parameters) from transient errors (timeouts, rate limits)](https://www.sitepoint.com/error-handling-strategies-for-probabilistic-code-execution/). Deterministic errors should be tagged as non-retryable to prevent infinite retry loops.

**Averaging across runs**: Average evaluation scores across 3+ runs to absorb non-deterministic variance. The shift is from "is this the right answer?" to "is this a good enough answer?"

**Context mutation between retries**: Blind retries without changing the prompt context [produce the same class of failure](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/14729). Effective retries enrich the context with error metadata (attempt number, correction strategy, error classification).

**Iteration caps**: OpenObserve caps healing at 5 iterations. metaswarm uses spec-driven pass criteria rather than iteration counts. Both prevent runaway loops.

**Separation of concerns**: Deterministic checks (build, lint, type check) should never be flaky. Browser-based checks may be flaky due to timing. The QA agent should weight deterministic failures higher than potentially flaky browser-based failures.

**Confidence:** Substantiated -- synthesized from multiple sources; specific strategies have working implementations.

#### 4.4 Acceptance criteria interpretation

Addy Osmani's [guide on writing specs for AI agents](https://addyosmani.com/blog/good-spec/) identifies six core specification areas that agents can interpret:

1. **Commands**: Exact executable statements (`npm test`, `npm run build`)
2. **Testing**: Framework details and coverage expectations
3. **Project structure**: Expected file organization
4. **Code style**: Examples over prose descriptions
5. **Git workflow**: Branch naming, commit formats
6. **Boundaries**: Hard constraints (always do, ask first, never do)

The three-tier boundary system is particularly relevant for QA agents:
- **Always**: Actions taken autonomously ("Always run tests before declaring pass")
- **Ask first**: High-impact checks requiring human review ("Ask before declaring a visual regression")
- **Never**: Absolute prohibitions ("Never approve code with `as any`")

For mapping specs to concrete checks, structured conformance suites (often YAML-based) specify expected inputs and outputs that implementations must satisfy. This creates machine-checkable contracts derived directly from specifications.

**Confidence:** Substantiated -- based on a single well-regarded source (Addy Osmani at Google); consistent with general prompt engineering principles.

#### 4.5 Evidence collection and reporting

Anthropic's [eval guidance](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/demystifying-evals-for-ai-agents) identifies three types of evaluation signals:

1. **Transcripts**: Full interaction records with tool calls and reasoning
2. **Outcomes**: Final environmental state verification (does the test pass? does the DOM look right?)
3. **Metrics**: Quantitative measurements (latency, token usage, turn count)

The existing HAI3 `chrome-devtools-runtime-tester` produces a structured validation report with:
- Feature under test and artifact reference
- Test environment details
- Per-criterion verdict with DevTools actions taken and evidence collected
- Edge case verification table
- Summary with pass/fail counts

The `implementation-reviewer` produces a BLOCK/APPROVE decision with:
- Blockers with file:line references
- Section-by-section findings
- Binary verdict -- everything is either BLOCK or clean

A unified QA report needs to combine both: structured per-criterion verdicts (from runtime testing) with pattern compliance findings (from static analysis), all with concrete evidence. The key principle from Anthropic: "when a task fails, the transcript tells you whether the agent made a genuine mistake or whether your graders rejected a valid solution."

**Confidence:** Substantiated -- synthesized from existing HAI3 agent formats and Anthropic eval guidance.

---

### 5. Agent prompt engineering for QA roles

#### 5.1 Effective QA agent prompt patterns

Synthesized from successful QA agent implementations:

**Checklist-driven validation**: The most reliable QA agents follow explicit checklists rather than open-ended quality assessment. The implementation-reviewer's step-by-step review checklist (architecture -> forbidden patterns -> type safety -> stray files -> task sync -> legacy) produces consistent results because each step has concrete actions and pass/fail criteria.

**Evidence-before-verdict**: OpenObserve's Sentinel and the HAI3 runtime tester both require the agent to state what it observed before stating whether it meets criteria. This prevents the agent from reasoning backward from a desired verdict.

**Concrete over vague**: Microsoft's [prompt engineering for testers guide](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azuredevcommunityblog/writing-effective-prompts-for-testing-scenarios-ai-assisted-quality-engineering/4488001) identifies overloaded prompts and natural language overuse as common anti-patterns. Structured output requirements and environment details produce more reliable results.

**Self-verification**: Addy Osmani's spec guide advocates building "self-audit into the process" by instructing agents to review outputs against requirements checklists before finalizing.

**Confidence:** Substantiated -- consistent across multiple independent sources.

#### 5.2 Thoroughness vs efficiency

The tension: thorough validation catches more issues but costs more time, tokens, and context window space. Strategies for balancing:

**Tiered validation depth**: Run cheap deterministic checks first (build, lint, type check). Only proceed to expensive runtime validation if deterministic checks pass. Only proceed to deep code inspection if runtime validation passes.

**Risk-proportional effort**: Assess the change scope and allocate testing effort accordingly. A one-line CSS fix does not warrant full DOM traversal and network analysis.

**Fail-fast design**: The implementation-reviewer uses a "BLOCK early" philosophy -- "false positives are better than false negatives." For a QA agent, this means: report the first blocking failure immediately rather than completing the full checklist.

**Model selection for cost**: Claude Code subagents support per-agent [model selection](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents). Sonnet balances capability and speed for routine validation; Opus provides stronger reasoning for complex quality assessment. The Agentic QE Fleet uses [TinyDancer routing](https://github.com/proffesor-for-testing/agentic-qe): simple tasks to Haiku, moderate to Sonnet, complex/critical to Opus.

**Confidence:** Substantiated -- model routing is documented in Claude Code and Agentic QE Fleet; tiered validation is engineering judgment supported by cost data.

#### 5.3 Read-only vs can-execute permissions

The existing agents split permissions differently:
- `chrome-devtools-runtime-tester`: Read-only on files, but can interact with the browser (navigate, click, fill forms, evaluate scripts). Cannot modify files.
- `implementation-reviewer`: Read-only on everything. No Bash, no browser, no file modification.

For a unified QA agent, the permission question is: should it be able to execute commands?

**Case for execution access (Bash)**:
- Running `tsc --noEmit`, `eslint`, `npm test` provides deterministic pass/fail signals
- Running build commands verifies compilation
- Checking git status verifies expected file changes
- These are the cheapest, most reliable validation methods available

**Case against execution access**:
- Execution introduces side effects (file creation, process spawning)
- A QA agent that can execute might accidentally modify state
- Principle of least privilege suggests read-only is safer

**The industry consensus leans toward execution access with scoped restrictions.** Claude Code supports this through `PreToolUse` hooks that can validate commands before execution (e.g., blocking write operations while allowing read-only shell commands). The PubNub best practices guide recommends [PM and Architect as read-heavy; Implementer gets Edit/Write/Bash](https://www.pubnub.com/blog/best-practices-for-claude-code-sub-agents/). QA/Validation falls in between -- it needs Bash for running checks but should not need Write/Edit.

AWS's [Agentic AI Security Scoping Matrix](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/the-agentic-ai-security-scoping-matrix-a-framework-for-securing-autonomous-ai-systems/) recommends fine-grained scopes rather than broad access: define exactly which commands a QA agent can run (test suites, linters, type checkers, build commands) rather than granting unrestricted shell access.

**Confidence:** Substantiated -- based on Claude Code documentation, security best practices, and industry patterns.

#### 5.4 Preventing the QA bottleneck

The QA agent becomes a bottleneck when it:
- Takes longer than the developer agent to validate
- Produces too many false positives requiring investigation
- Runs sequentially when parallel execution is possible
- Validates things that automated tools handle better

Prevention strategies:

**Parallel execution of independent checks**: Run build verification, lint checking, type checking, and test execution in parallel rather than sequentially. Claude Code supports this through multiple Bash tool calls in a single response.

**Short-circuit on failure**: If the build fails, skip all downstream checks. If a blocking pattern is found, report immediately rather than completing the full review.

**Limit scope per invocation**: CodeScene recommends [multi-phase feedback at generation, commit, and PR stages](https://codescene.com/blog/agentic-ai-coding-best-practice-patterns-for-speed-with-quality) rather than one comprehensive review. Each phase checks different things at different depths.

**Measurable criteria over subjective judgment**: Quality gates based on `tsc --noEmit` exit code, test pass rate, and lint errors are faster than quality gates based on "does this code follow best practices."

**Cap agent turns**: Claude Code subagents support a [`maxTurns` configuration](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents) that limits the number of agentic turns before the subagent stops, preventing runaway validation.

**Confidence:** Substantiated -- strategies synthesized from multiple production implementations.

#### 5.5 Developer-to-QA handoff structure

The handoff artifact between developer and QA should include:

1. **What changed**: Files modified, features implemented (git diff summary)
2. **What to verify**: Specific acceptance criteria or behavioral requirements
3. **How to verify**: URLs to visit, commands to run, expected outcomes
4. **Known limitations**: What the developer knows does not work yet

PubNub's best practices describe [hook-driven suggestions](https://www.pubnub.com/blog/best-practices-for-claude-code-sub-agents/) at handoff: a `SubagentStop` hook that prints readable next steps (e.g., "Use the qa subagent on 'feature-slug'"), requiring human approval before proceeding. Each agent ends with explicit "Definition of Done" checklists -- missing checkpoints halt execution.

Claude Code's subagent architecture naturally supports this: the orchestrator passes context when delegating to the QA subagent, and the QA subagent returns structured results.

**Confidence:** Substantiated -- based on Claude Code documentation and PubNub patterns.

### 6. Tool selection for QA agents

#### 6.1 Minimum viable toolset

Based on analysis of what the two existing agents use and what the unified agent needs:

**Essential (validation cannot function without these)**:
- `Read` -- inspect source code, configuration, specs
- `Glob` -- find files by pattern (stray files, expected outputs)
- `Grep` -- search for patterns (forbidden patterns, markers)
- `Bash` -- run build, lint, type check, test commands; check exit codes

**Important (needed for runtime validation)**:
- Chrome DevTools navigation and interaction tools (`navigate_page`, `click`, `fill`, `type_text`, `press_key`)
- Chrome DevTools inspection tools (`evaluate_script`, `take_screenshot`, `list_console_messages`, `list_network_requests`)

**Useful (deeper validation capabilities)**:
- Chrome DevTools performance tools (`performance_start_trace`, `performance_stop_trace`, `performance_analyze_insight`)
- Chrome DevTools advanced tools (`hover`, `drag`, `emulate`, `resize_page`)
- `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` -- verify external resources, check API documentation

**Not needed**:
- `Write` / `Edit` -- QA agent should not modify files
- `TodoWrite` -- QA agent reports findings, does not track tasks
- Git operations -- QA agent validates, does not commit

#### 6.2 Browser automation tool trade-offs

For the HAI3 context specifically:

**Chrome DevTools MCP (current approach)**:
- Already integrated and configured in the repo
- Provides the deepest debugging capabilities (console, network, performance)
- Chrome-only, but HAI3 targets Chrome for development
- High token cost (26 tools, 18k tokens for definitions)
- Ideal for: debugging, performance analysis, deep inspection

**Playwright MCP (alternative)**:
- Cross-browser support (less relevant for HAI3 dev workflow)
- Accessibility tree approach is more deterministic for element selection
- Better CI/CD integration story
- Lower token cost (21 tools, 13.7k tokens)
- Ideal for: user flow simulation, regression testing

**Combined approach** (suggested by [BSWEN](https://docs.bswen.com/blog/2026-02-25-mcp-browser-comparison/)): Use Chrome DevTools for deep analysis and debugging, Playwright for functional automation. However, this doubles the token budget for tool definitions.

**Confidence:** Substantiated -- based on comparative benchmarks and HAI3 context analysis.

#### 6.3 Token efficiency considerations

Token usage is a practical constraint for QA agents because they consume context window space for tool definitions, tool call parameters, and tool call results.

Chrome DevTools MCP uses [18k tokens](https://docs.bswen.com/blog/2026-02-25-mcp-browser-comparison/) just for tool definitions (9% of Claude's context window). Combined with Bash, Read, Grep, Glob, and the agent's system prompt, a QA agent can consume 25-30% of its context window before doing any actual validation.

Token efficiency strategies:
- Only include tools the agent will actually use (omit rarely-used tools like `drag`, `emulate`)
- Use `disallowedTools` to exclude tools rather than explicitly listing all allowed tools
- Run deterministic CLI checks before browser checks to potentially short-circuit
- Use [Sonnet model](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents) for routine validation to reduce cost

An emerging approach is [OpenBrowser MCP](https://docs.bswen.com/blog/2026-02-25-mcp-browser-comparison/), which uses a single tool (Python code execution with browser context) instead of many specialized tools, reducing token overhead by 3-6x. However, it requires the LLM to write Python code for browser interactions, which introduces different failure modes.

**Confidence:** Substantiated -- token measurements from BSWEN benchmarks; strategies are engineering judgment.

#### 6.4 Screenshot and visual validation

Screenshots serve two purposes for a QA agent:

1. **Evidence collection**: Capturing the visual state of the application for the validation report. The `chrome-devtools-runtime-tester` already uses `take_screenshot` for this.

2. **Visual regression detection**: Comparing current screenshots against baselines to detect unintended visual changes.

AI agents with vision capabilities (Claude, GPT-4) can [interpret visual cues, context, and user intent](https://www.askui.com/blog-posts/leading-ai-visual-testing-tools) to detect unintended visual changes without pixel-level comparison tools. The agent can take a screenshot and reason about whether the UI looks correct based on the specification.

However, [DOM-based interactions are faster but consume more tokens, while screenshot-based interactions are slower but more token-efficient](https://research.aimultiple.com/test-agent/). For a QA agent, DOM-based validation is preferred for structural checks (element presence, attribute values) and screenshot-based validation is preferred for appearance checks (layout, spacing, color).

**Confidence:** Substantiated -- vision-based validation is documented but not extensively benchmarked for QA agent use cases.

### 7. Anti-patterns and failure modes

#### 7.1 Common QA agent design mistakes

**The "super agent" failure**: OpenObserve found that early attempts using a single agent for all QA tasks failed. [Specialization with bounded agents proved superior to generalization](https://openobserve.ai/blog/autonomous-qa-testing-ai-agents-claude-code/). The failure mode: a single agent trying to do code review, runtime testing, performance analysis, and security scanning produces mediocre results across all dimensions.

**Overloaded prompts**: Microsoft's prompt engineering guide identifies [prompts requesting multiple test types in one step](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azuredevcommunityblog/writing-effective-prompts-for-testing-scenarios-ai-assisted-quality-engineering/4488001) as a common anti-pattern. Each validation concern should have clear, separate instructions.

**Natural language where structured output is required**: Validation results should be structured (pass/fail per criterion) rather than prose ("The application generally works well but there are some concerns...").

**Automation prompts without environment details**: The QA agent must know the exact URLs, ports, commands, and expected states to validate against. Vague instructions ("test the application") produce vague results.

**Confidence:** Corroborated -- consistent across Microsoft, OpenObserve, and multiple implementation reports.

#### 7.2 The rubber-stamp problem

A QA agent that always passes is worse than no QA agent -- it provides false confidence. Causes and mitigations:

**Cause: Sycophantic behavior**: LLMs tend toward positive assessments, especially of work they "understand" was done by a collaborator agent. The Agentic QE Fleet implements ["Loki-mode" anti-sycophancy scoring](https://github.com/proffesor-for-testing/agentic-qe) that catches hollow tests and rejects tautological assertions.

**Cause: No concrete pass/fail criteria**: If the QA agent is told to "check if the code looks good," it will almost always say it looks good. If told to "run `npm test` and report the exit code," it cannot fabricate a passing result.

**Cause: No adversarial test cases**: The QA agent should test not just the happy path but also error conditions, edge cases, and boundary values.

**Mitigation: Deterministic checks as ground truth**: Build, lint, type check, and test results cannot be rubber-stamped. They produce concrete, verifiable outputs. The QA agent should run these first and report exact results.

**Mitigation: Evidence requirements**: The current `chrome-devtools-runtime-tester` requires "concrete DevTools evidence" for every claim. The implementation-reviewer requires file:line references. Requiring evidence prevents ungrounded verdicts.

**Mitigation: "BLOCK by default" philosophy**: The current implementation-reviewer states "if you're unsure, BLOCK -- false positives are better than false negatives." This creates a conservative bias that counters sycophantic tendencies.

**Confidence:** Corroborated -- rubber-stamping is widely documented; mitigations are demonstrated in multiple implementations.

#### 7.3 The bottleneck problem

A QA agent that blocks developer velocity defeats its purpose. Observed causes:

**Cause: Running all checks sequentially**: A full review (static analysis + build + lint + type check + browser testing) can take many agent turns. Running independent checks in parallel reduces wall-clock time.

**Cause: Over-testing low-risk changes**: A one-line documentation fix does not need full DOM validation. Risk-proportional effort reduces overhead for low-risk changes.

**Cause: Manual verification becomes the bottleneck**: With agents iterating at high speed, [manual verification quickly becomes the bottleneck](https://codescene.com/blog/agentic-ai-coding-best-practice-patterns-for-speed-with-quality). Higher-level automation is needed to match agent speed.

**Cause: Too many false positives**: If the QA agent flags issues that are not real problems, developers learn to ignore its output. Precision matters more than recall for sustained trust.

**Mitigation: maxTurns cap**: Prevent runaway validation with a [turn limit](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents).

**Mitigation: Tiered validation**: Quick checks for small changes, full validation for significant changes.

**Confidence:** Substantiated -- bottleneck patterns documented across CodeScene and agent workflow literature.

#### 7.4 False positive and negative management

**False positives** (flagging correct code as broken):
- Erode trust in the QA agent over time
- Common with overly broad pattern matching (e.g., grep for `any` catching variable names like `anyMethod`)
- Mitigate by requiring context around matches, not just pattern hits
- The implementation-reviewer's approach of "everything is either a BLOCK or clean" with no advisory middle ground maximizes false positive rate for maximum recall -- this is a deliberate trade-off

**False negatives** (missing real issues):
- More dangerous than false positives -- creates false confidence
- Common when the QA agent does not test error paths or edge cases
- Mitigate by requiring explicit edge case verification (the current runtime tester has a dedicated edge case section)
- Deterministic checks (build, lint, type check) have zero false negative rate for their scope

**Confidence:** Substantiated -- standard quality engineering principles applied to agent context.

#### 7.5 Agentic system failure patterns

Concentrix identifies [12 failure patterns](https://www.concentrix.com/insights/blog/12-failure-patterns-of-agentic-ai-systems/) in agentic AI systems. The patterns most relevant to QA agents:

1. **Black box decision-making**: QA agents must expose how they reached their verdict, not just state it. Evidence-based reporting is the antidote.
2. **Siloed context**: A QA agent working across fragmented data (code, browser state, specs) without full context makes bad decisions. The agent must access all relevant information.
3. **Broken handoffs**: When the developer-to-QA handoff loses information (what changed, what to verify), the QA agent validates the wrong things.
4. **Escalation misfires**: A QA agent that escalates too little lets bugs through; one that escalates too much becomes a bottleneck. Threshold calibration is critical.
5. **Automation bias**: Humans over-trusting the QA agent's verdicts without scrutiny -- the mirror image of rubber-stamping.

**Confidence:** Substantiated -- based on Concentrix analysis; patterns are consistent with observed failure modes in other sources.

## Key takeaways

- The **generator-critic pattern** is the dominant architecture for QA validation in multi-agent systems, with the critic validating against predefined, concrete criteria (not open-ended quality assessment). Quality gates must be **blocking state transitions, not advisory** -- this is the strongest finding across all implementations. (Corroborated -- Google ADK, metaswarm, OpenObserve, CodeScene all converge on this)

- **Specialization outperforms generalization** for QA agents. OpenObserve's single "super agent" failed; their 8-agent pipeline succeeded. HAMY's 9 parallel agents produce ~75% useful feedback vs. <50% from single agents. If the unified QA agent scope is too broad, quality degrades. (Substantiated -- two independent implementations report this finding, though the threshold between "focused enough" and "too many agents" is not well-defined)

- The most effective QA validation stack is **tiered**: cheap deterministic checks first (Bash: build, lint, type check, test), then runtime validation (Chrome DevTools: DOM, network, console), then code inspection (Read/Grep: patterns, architecture). Short-circuit on failure at each tier. (Substantiated -- consistent ordering principle across all production implementations)

- **Token efficiency is a practical constraint** that limits how many browser tools a QA agent can use. Chrome DevTools MCP consumes 18k tokens just for tool definitions (9% of context window). Tool selection must be intentional, not exhaustive. (Corroborated -- BSWEN benchmarks provide exact measurements)

- **Deterministic checks are the foundation**. Running `tsc --noEmit`, `eslint`, and `npm test` via Bash cannot be rubber-stamped, produces zero false negatives for their scope, and catches the majority of implementation issues. Browser-based runtime validation should supplement, not replace, these checks. (Substantiated -- Anthropic eval guidance, Block testing pyramid, and multiple production systems all prioritize deterministic foundations)

## Open questions

1. **Single agent vs. multiple specialized agents**: Should the unified QA agent be one agent with a tiered checklist, or multiple focused agents (static-checker, runtime-tester, pattern-scanner) orchestrated in parallel? The research points toward specialization but the coordination overhead of multiple agents is not well-measured.

2. **Chrome DevTools tool subset**: The full Chrome DevTools MCP provides 26 tools. How many does the QA agent actually need? A reduced set (navigate, click, fill, evaluate_script, take_screenshot, list_console_messages, list_network_requests) would save significant token budget. What capabilities are lost?

3. **Model selection**: The `chrome-devtools-runtime-tester` uses Sonnet; the `implementation-reviewer` uses Opus. Should the unified agent use Opus (stronger reasoning for code analysis) or Sonnet (faster, cheaper for runtime checks)? The Agentic QE Fleet uses dynamic routing based on task complexity -- is this practical for a Claude Code subagent?

4. **Feedback loop iteration cap**: How many QA-developer cycles should be allowed before escalating to human review? OpenObserve uses 5. metaswarm uses spec-driven criteria. The right number for HAI3 is undefined.

5. **Hook-based enforcement**: Should quality gates be enforced via Claude Code hooks (PreToolUse, SubagentStop) or via agent prompt instructions? Hook enforcement is structural and cannot be bypassed; prompt enforcement relies on the model following instructions.

6. **Persistent memory**: Claude Code subagents support [persistent memory](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents) that survives across conversations. Should the QA agent learn from past validations (common failure patterns, project-specific checks, recurring issues)? This could improve efficiency but introduces state management complexity.

7. **Scope of static analysis**: The `implementation-reviewer` includes architecture-level checks (SOLID compliance, class structure). Some of these overlap with the `architecture-critic` agent's domain. Where does the QA agent's static analysis responsibility end and the architecture critic's begin?

8. **Handling unreachable browser state**: If the dev server is not running or the application is in a broken state, the QA agent cannot perform runtime validation. How should it handle this -- fail the entire validation, or degrade gracefully to static-only checks?
