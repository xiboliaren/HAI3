## Context and Problem Statement

Screen lazy-loading requires translation data to be separated so translations do not all load on language switch. A monolithic translation file defeats lazy loading; a pure per-screen model duplicates shared content such as menu titles. A model that satisfies both constraints is required.

## Decision Drivers

* Translation loading must align with screen lazy loading so content translations are fetched only when a screen is visited
* Menu titles shared across a screenset must not be duplicated in every screen translation file

## Considered Options

* Single screenset-level translation file containing all content
* Pure per-screen model — each screen owns all its translations including shared titles
* Two-tier hybrid model — screenset-level for menu titles only, screen-level for all content

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Two-tier hybrid model — screenset-level for menu titles only, screen-level for all content", because it enables true lazy loading of screen content translations while preventing duplication of shared titles, and the strict separation rule makes ownership unambiguous.

### Consequences

* Good, because lazy loading works for translations, ownership is clear, and there is no duplication that defeats optimization
* Bad, because two translation files per screen area (screenset-level and screen-level) must be maintained, and authors must follow the strict separation rule

### Confirmation

Translation directories at `src/screensets/*/translations/` contain separate screenset-level and screen-level files. `packages/i18n/src/registry.ts` provides `I18nRegistry.createLoader()` as a static method that wraps language-specific imports with error handling to satisfy Vite's static analysis requirements.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Single screenset-level translation file containing all content

* Good, because simple authoring — one file per language per screenset
* Bad, because the entire translation bundle loads upfront, defeating screen lazy loading

### Pure per-screen model — each screen owns all its translations including shared titles

* Good, because each screen is fully self-contained
* Bad, because menu titles and other shared strings are duplicated across every screen translation file, creating a maintenance burden

### Two-tier hybrid model — screenset-level for menu titles only, screen-level for all content

* Good, because translation chunks align exactly with screen code chunks, and shared titles live in one place per screenset
* Bad, because the strict separation rule (screenset files MUST NOT contain screen content) must be enforced by convention rather than tooling

## More Information

`I18nRegistry.createLoader()` uses a static method signature specifically to satisfy Vite's requirement for statically analysable dynamic import paths. Dynamic import paths constructed at runtime were evaluated and rejected for this reason.

This decision directly addresses:

* `cpt-hai3-fr-i18n-hybrid-namespace` — two-tier namespace model definition
* `cpt-hai3-fr-i18n-lazy-chunks` — translation chunk loading aligned with screen lazy loading
* `cpt-hai3-component-i18n` — i18n registry and loader implementation
